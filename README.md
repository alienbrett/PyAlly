[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/037c01d127d845b6892416f199747f52)](https://app.codacy.com/manual/alienbrett/PyAlly?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=alienbrett/PyAlly&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Settings)

Take control of your [Ally bank](https://www.ally.com/api/invest/documentation/getting-started/) finances through Python.
Buy stocks and options in an instant, and stay up-to-date with your investments.

Ally Bank's investment platform is perfect for smaller investors who value a mature web/mobile interface, and low brokerage fees. I made this wrapper so that I could more easily integrate the platform with Python, and reduce the need for human oversight on my account.

After setting up API keys, PyAlly can provide the basic/essential Ally brokerage transaction functions from a simple python request.

Make sure to [read the docs](https://alienbrett.github.io/PyAlly)!


## Version 1.0.1

The lastest redesign preserves many features of the old interface, and incorporates a few new ones.
Version 1.0 has been designed around a simple interface which should make modifying orders easier, and many operations more pythonic.
Please note that this version breaks compatibility with all V0.X.X.

* Added pythonic methods for manipulating account watchlists
* Added quote streaming support
* Simplified account operation methods
* Many new order operations. Orders can now be modified or cancelled in an intuitive way
