Take control of your [Ally bank](https://www.ally.com/api/invest/documentation/getting-started/) finances through Python.
Buy stocks and options in an instant, and stay up-to-date with your investments.

Ally Bank's investment platform is perfect for smaller investors who value a mature web/mobile interface, and low brokerage fees. I made this wrapper so that I could more easily integrate the platform with Python, and reduce the need for human oversight on my account.

After setting up API keys, PyAlly can provide the basic/essential Ally brokerage transaction functions from a simple python request.

Make sure to [read the docs](https://alienbrett.github.io/PyAlly)!

If you're dying to buy me a beer, I accept venmo at @alienbrett. That said, feel no obligation; this is free software and it's here for you to use.
