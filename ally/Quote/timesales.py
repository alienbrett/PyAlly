    """Gets the most current market data on the price of a symbol.

            Gets a dataset of price points and other information for a symbol.
            Option symbols unfortunately are not accessible from this interface,
            so only stocks can be used.

            Must specify the start and end date on the range requested.
            The API can only return 5 days of intraday prices, the 5 most
            recent trading days, the current day included. Partial data
            will be returned for the current day, if the query occurs
            during the trading hours of a trading day.

            Start and end date should take the form "2019-12-31". This
            interface will be preserved, but datetime instances may be accepted
            in the future as well.

            Args:
                    symbols:
                            single symbol to query historical quotes on

                    startdate:

                    enddate:
                            string, end date of the interval

                    interval:
                            string, specify the size of each time interval.
                            Must be one of ('1min','5min','15min')

                    dataframe:
                            flag, specifies whether to return data in pandas dataframe or flat list of dictionaries.

                    block: Specify whether to block thread if request exceeds rate limit

            Returns:
                    Depends on dataframe flag. Will return pandas dataframe, or possibly
                    list of dictionaries, each one a single quote.

            Raises:
                    RateLimitException: If block=False, rate limit problems will be raised
