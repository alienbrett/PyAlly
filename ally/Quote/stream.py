            The stream generator that yields dictionaries. Specify one or more
            symbols, and the stream object establishes a connection with the API servers,
            then starts returning symbol-keyed quote objects in real-time.

            Args:
                    symbols:
                            string or list of strings, each string a symbol to be queried.
                            Notice symbols=['spy'], symbols='spy both work.

            Returns:
                    A generator

            Example:

    .. code-block:: python

                    for quote in a.stream('tsla'):
                            print(quote)
