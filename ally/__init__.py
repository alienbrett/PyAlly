"""Ally module.

Take control of your Ally Bank finances through Python.
Buy stocks and options in an instant, and stay up-to-date with your investments.

Ally Bank's investment platform is perfect for smaller investors who value a mature web/mobile interface, and low brokerage fees. I made this wrapper so that I could more easily integrate the platform with Python, and reduce the need for human oversight on my account.

After setting up API keys, PyAlly can provide the basic/essential Ally brokerage transaction functions from a simple python request.

Make sure to read the docss at https://alienbrett.github.io/PyAlly
