PyAlly Trading Library
==================================

Take control of your `Ally bank`_ finances through Python. Buy stocks and options in an instant, and stay up-to-date with your investments.

Ally Bank's investment platform is perfect for smaller investors who value a mature web/mobile interface, and low brokerage fees. I made this wrapper so that I could more easily integrate the platform with Python, and reduce the need for human oversight on my account.

After setting up API keys, PyAlly can provide the basic/essential Ally brokerage transaction functions from a simple python request.

The project can be cloned from github_ or installed through pip on pypi_.

Version 1.1.2
----------------

The lastest redesign preserves many features of the old interface, and incorporates a few new ones. Version 1.0 has been designed around a simple interface which should make modifying orders easier, and many operations more pythonic. Please note that this version breaks compatibility with all V0.X.X.

* Added pythonic methods for manipulating account watchlists
* Added quote streaming support
* Added rate limit functionality
* Simplified account operation methods
* Intelligent rate limiting
* Many new order operations. Orders can now be modified or cancelled in an intuitive way
* Option searching
* Toplists
* News

Note that parts of the news searching is broken. Ally's contractor who supplies information for news articles has had trouble suppling some information.

Planned Features
-----------------

* Multi-leg orders
