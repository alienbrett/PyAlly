# PyAlly 0.3.6
Python3 wrapper for [Ally Invest brokerage API](https://www.ally.com/api/invest/documentation/getting-started/ "Ally Invest API")

Ally Bank's investment platform is perfect for smaller investors who value a mature web/mobile interface, and low brokerage fees. I made this wrapper so that I could more easily integrate the platform with Python, and reduce the need for human oversight on my account.

After setting up API keys, PyAlly can provide the basic/essential Ally brokerage transaction functions from a simple python request.

If you're dying to buy me a beer, I accept venmo at @alienbrett. That said, feel no obligation; this is free software and it's here for you to use.
